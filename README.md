# Quilox Auth ðŸ”‘
Quilox-Auth is a robust and scalable authentication and authorization boilerplate built on the Node.js and Express.js stack. It provides a secure foundation for any API, featuring:

# Overview
JSON Web Token (JWT) Authentication: For stateless and secure user sessions.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): To manage and restrict user permissions.

Data Validation: Ensures incoming data is clean and valid.

Secure Password Handling: Uses bcrypt for one-way password hashing.

Modular Architecture: Keeps the codebase organized and easy to extend.

This project is designed to be a starting point, providing all the core security features you need to build your API with confidence.This module is built with security best practices in mind, including password hashing, token expiration, and secure route protection.

# Prerequisites
To use this module, you should have the following installed:

Node.js (LTS version)

MongoDB

npm

Installation
You can install Quilox Auth in your Node.js project using npm.

npm install quilox-auth

Since this module is a complete solution, you'll also need to install the core dependencies used in the project.

npm install express mongoose bcrypt jsonwebtoken dotenv

# Getting Started
Follow these steps to get your project up and running.

1. Clone the Repository
Bash

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-project-directory>

2. Install Dependencies
Use npm to install all the necessary packages for the project.

Bash

npm install

3. Configuration (.env)
Create a .env file in the root of your project to store sensitive information.

MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1h
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your_super_secret_refresh_key
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN=7d

4. Run the Server
Start the application using the following command:

Bash

node server.js
The server should now be running, and you'll see a message in your console: Server is listening on port 3000.
